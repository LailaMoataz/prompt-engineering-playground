# prompt-engineering-playground

## Problem
Crafting effective prompts for LLMs is challenging and requires experimentation.

## Solution
This project documents prompt engineering experiments,
showing what works, what doesn’t, and why.

## Structure
- `prompts/` → collection of tested prompts
- `notebooks/` → experiments and results
- `README.md` → project overview

## Usage
Add new prompts in the `prompts` folder or document experiments in the notebook.
